- packages are just containers/boxes for classes
- they keep class names compartmentalized
- in simple terms a package is just a folder
- you cannot have two classes of the same name in a package.
- you should mention the path whenever writing a file.
- by convention, if you are making something for a company like xyz.com then the package name would be com.xyz
